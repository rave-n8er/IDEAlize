This app is used to upload new ideas to the server.

DESIGN:
The app was built using a responsive Bootstrap theme.  A basic PHP routine handles validation and posting. 
A sample contact page project was used as a starting point.

USAGE:
Run the idealize.php page.
Fill in the form.  Include a picture/diagram (optional)
Click Submit to send the data to the server (and optionally upload the picture)

NOTE:
An "uploads" folder is required off the root of the application, into which files will be uploaded.
